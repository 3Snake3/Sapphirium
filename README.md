# Main Factions
`Crimson Agate` - The faction created a software virus called «Bloodrage». Faction technologies use it to effectively crack down on enemy units. Ruby is the main source of their powers.
<br>
<br>`Indigo` - The faction that created the most powerful refrigerant at the moment is Ledonite. The faction effectively uses frosty weapons, forcing the enemy forces to freeze in place and be broken into many pieces. 
<br>
<br>`Golden Thread` - The holy faction representing peace, harmony, pacification. In their weapons, they use sacred fire, which carries particles of gold dust, which makes enemies heavier, forcing them to move slower, but at the same time they become stronger, as elements of gold are melted into their cases.
<br>
<br>`Beam` - A faction developed in electricity that has created and put into circulation resources containing high-energy components to create advanced electrical technologies.
<br>
<br>`Dart` - A faction of the standard armament, but with a small feature. Its weapons are equipped with dart-like bullets capable of piercing enemy targets, and can also be high-speed. Higher-level weapons are switching to the use of homing strike missiles.
<br>
<br>`Sandbank` - The faction uses an ancient type of structures in the form of siege engines, making ammunition for them from coal, stones and sand. Coal increases the flammability, stone causes severe damage from impact, sand covers the enemies.
<br>
<br>`Emerald Light` - A faction acting as a support. It uses the healing properties of the emerald to repair units and buildings.

# Element Factions
`Fire` - A faction that commands the element of fire. Its flame spreads everywhere, burning everything in its path.
<br>
<br>`Water` - This faction is able to control the element of water. Water can take absolutely any form that the faction can use in its weapons.
<br>
<br>`Lightning` - The faction has mastered the power to command lightning, reaching the heavens. All those who obstructed, stood in the way, will be punished by heaven.
<br>
<br>`Light` - A faction with the powerful power of the bright white light, blinding the enemy's gaze. In its possession is the most expensive stone - a Diamond.
<br>
<br>`Shadow` - A faction of dark forces that carries fear, malice, hatred, destruction and chaos... Everything that is swallowed up by darkness will be doomed forever...
<br>
<br>`Acid` - The faction that created an extremely dangerous liquid substance similar to acid. This liquid is capable of corroding metal in seconds, gradually splitting it into atoms.

# Erekir Branches
The Erekir includes several development branches based on Items.
<br>`Topaz` - Bases topaz branch of turrets equipped with overload mechanics. The «Hunters» faction of ground units, which is based on hunting ideology, slows down, immobilize its targets and causes increased damage. The branch also has its own liquid structures.
<br>
<br>`Sapphire` - Bases a protective structures in the form of energy-absorbing walls, and a branch of turrets that are capable of repairing buildings in the area of their action radius. This branch also has its own core capable of self-healing and power generation, and branch provides a prototype of repair projector.
<br>
<br>`Amethyst` - A branch based on faith and religion. It bases lines of turrets and units, which reduce the movement speed of enemy units, or immobilize them. The first of all the previous branches opens power production that based on amethysts.
<br>
<br>`Ruby` - The branch opens up a third unique line of units called «Ghosts», which are invulnerable to enemy attacks under certain conditions, but the weakness of their abilities in the fact that it stops working within a certain radius. «Ghosts» are able to penetrate the enemy structural system, reduce efficiency of most enemy buildings and inflict additional damage on buildings that consume or produce power. The ruby branch occupies a place below the amethyst branch in power production.
<br>
<br>`Creostone` - Another resource whose branch is based on it, which arrived from serpulo. The branch provides strong weapons, power structures and factories that produce powerful gas fuel - `Creotine` and high-strength material `Carved Alloy`.
<br>
<br>`Carved Alloy` - Latest and most powerful branch, based on heavily armored and charged structures. The turrets of this branch use a carved alloy as ammunition, which has an incredibly high energy created by melting a large amount of tungsten together with a surge alloy. When receiving damage, structures absorb enemy surge energy, as a result of which they are able to repair themselves and splash out piercing blasts.
